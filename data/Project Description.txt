For GovHack 2015 we decided to encourage Melbourne's citizens and visitors to expore all it has to offer.
PROJECTNAME is a webapp that you can run on your mobile device or computer.
It uses your location to determine if you have visited any of the several hundred locations of interest we have collected from open data.
We believe this project will be successful at educating users where traditional approaches fail.
Other web apps function as simple directories that you only ever visit to answer very specific questions.
Instead of that, PROJECTNAME uses game mechanics to taps into its users' drive to explore and collect.

We have used several datasets to generate our points of interest. These were then divided into 12 categories.
The three that we are most happy to be able to include are: current and historically significant Aboriginal sites, official no smoking areas and ABC news
